In the last part of the paper we assess the possibility of repeating the artificial selection experiment without evolution, i.e. setting mutation parameter (mu_mut) to 0. We only apply this check for disassembly (d) (selection(s) and random (r)), but could be run for any other propagation. Appart from that, the code should be as the main model and any detail on how to run can be checked in the main_model folder.
