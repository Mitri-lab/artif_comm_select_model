Scripts to generate plots for the paper. All the scripts are written in python. Those labelled
as "_jupyter_notebook" are files with jupyter_notebook format. All the rest are txt files that
can be open an run in any python IDE, I used "spyder".

All the data required for these scripts is outside this directory in the "data" directory,
when running remember to adapt the path to the data (the name for each directory 
was kept the same of the original data we use to avoid confusion, and itÂ´s equally named here
and in the data folder). Remember to also specify where to save the plots within the scripts.
