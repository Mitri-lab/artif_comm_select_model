Run all the possible combinations of 15 species (the 32762 possible ones) for the 5 species sets (22-26). This is what I use as ancestral communities for the ranking

This script is writen in python and can be run for instance in a regular computer with a python IDE. Within the code it is needed to specify the path where to save 
the generated data and the seed for the random number generator (each seed will correspond to one species set, here we used 22-26). To get the results for the 5 species
sets, the script should be run 5 times separatelly, one with each seed.
