Here we store the scrips used to generate the data of the IBM, each folder is named as the data that it generates.
Within each folder there is a README with more details, and indications on how to run the particular version fo the model.
This folder is a bit redundant, as all the code is already present in the corresponding directory
of the "data" folder, so if this is not clear for you, you can check there as well.

The code is written in python, in some of the cases the scritps have been adapted to call
the python script externally from unix, which helps to paralelise runs.

The data we generate is needed for the following figures of the paper:
- main_model: all the figures from the IBM model.
- all_possible_combinations_of_species: Fig2E,F and Fig3G.
- run_evolved_communities_with_ancestral_species: Fig5B,C.
- run_monocultures_from_species_in_evolved_communities: Fig3G.
- sensitivity_analysis_tubes_subsamples_invasion_bottleneck: Fig6B-E.
- transfer_best_communties_without_selection: Fig6A.
