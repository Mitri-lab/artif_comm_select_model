function of simulated microbial communities" as off January 2023. ItÂ´s organised in 3 subdirectories:
- "data": contains all the required data generated as a result fo the simulations (a minimal version to save space), as well as a the script to generate the data.
- "scripts_plots": contains the scripts to generate all the plots of teh IBM in the main figures of the paper.
- "scripts_generate_data": constains the scripts to generate teh data in "data" directory, is a bit redundant as the scripts are also
