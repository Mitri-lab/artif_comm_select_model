# Artificial community selection models
This repository contains the code for the simulations included in "Novel artificial selection method improves function of simulated microbial communities" https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.08.523165

It also includes the data that was generated by this code and the scripts to generate the figures and the statistical analyses.

## About
The code concerns artifical selection of (simulated) microbial communities ... 

## Directory structure

## Prerequisites

## Installation

## Usage

## Individual-based model (IBM)
- "data": contains all the required data generated as a result fo the simulations (a minimal version to save space), as well as a the script to generate the data.
- "scripts_plots": contains the scripts to generate all the plots of teh IBM in the main figures of the paper.
- "scripts_generate_data": constains the scripts to generate teh data in "data" directory, is a bit redundant as the scripts are also
	present in "data" directory.

## ODE model
Simulate the model and selection method(s) by modifying the experimental parameters in casepars.py and selsimsettings.py and the model parameters for microbial growth etc in growthpars.py. Then, run with (for example) python3.7 and the random seed 12345 as 
> python3.7 SimselReps_Init.py 12345
The program could take up to 8h to run the standard settings (50 rounds of selection, 21 communities of 4 species chosen from a pool of 15) on a regular desktop or laptop computer.
